# RAG_ASSIGNMENT


In this case study, we will explore the fundamental components of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using a corpus of textual data.

we will learn to implement key stages of a basic RAG pipeline, including document loading, creating an embedding layer, using a vector database for storing embeddings, and the integration of retrieval with language generation models.

Along with this, we will utilise Gen AI Frameworks like LangChain or LlamaIndex. These frameworks provide developers with the necessary tools and abstractions that reduce the development time for building AI applications as well as developing LLM-agnostic applications. The aim is to develop practical skills in combining structured retrieval techniques with unstructured language generation to support intelligent information access.
